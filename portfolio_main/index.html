		<h1>
	&nbsp;About me
		</h1>
	  <p>Growing up, I have always been around a creative environment.
		My mother is a fabulous artist and my father is very innovative.
		I remember a laundry room full of paintings.
		I would always be sketching in the columns of school workbooks.
		I'm absolutely fascinated with art and music.
		One of my favourite pastimes is to just sit, sketch, and come up with new ideas.
		I find it very relaxing and calming.</p>
